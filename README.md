# PiHoleDiscordBot
This is a discord bot meant to be hosted on the device you're running pihole on. 

# Installation
Download bot.js on your computer and put it into a directory. Run *npm install* inside the directory bot.js is in.

Replace the variables at the top of the file with your own IP, name, bot token, prefix and profile picture URL. 

Run bot.js using your favorite program manager (I like PM2) or simply run *node bot.js*.
